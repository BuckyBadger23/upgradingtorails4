## Introduction

Even though Rails 4 is not yet released, it is important to start thinking
about the how easy or difficult it will be to upgrade your applications. It may
be possible to nip certain problems in the bud now to save pain later.

My goal with this book is to provide a clear path for upgrading Rails 3
applications to Rails 4.

The book is split into three major parts:

1. Deprecations: features removed in Rails 4 or marked for removal in a future
   release
2. New Features: novel features in Rails 4 to be aware of, especially when
   upgrading
3. Common Upgrading Scenarios: specific issues you might encounter when
   upgrading a Rails application and how to fix them

### Beta


This book is an evolving work in process, so please excuse any typos or errors.

It is also possible that since Rails 4 is currently in development, certain
versions of the book may contain inaccuracies. I keep a close watch on the
commit log for Rails 4, so these sorts of errors should be resolved in future
updates.

If you find errors or have questions, please reach out to me via email at
<rails4@andylindeman.com>.
