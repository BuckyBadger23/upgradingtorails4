## Introduction

Even though Rails 4 is not yet released, it is important to start thinking
about the upgradability of existing applications. It may be possible to nip
certain problems in the bud now to save pain later.

My goal with this book is to provide a clear path for upgrading Rails 3
applications to Rails 4.

The book is split into three major parts:

1. Deprecations: features removed in Rails 4 or marked for removal in a future
   release
2. New Features: novel features in Rails 4 to be aware of, especially when
   upgrading
3. Common Upgarding Errors: scenarios you might encounter when upgrading a
   Rails application and how to fix them

### Beta

This book is currently in pre-release form. While I hope to work them all out
before the book is finalized, there may be occasional typos and errors.

It is also possible that since Rails 4 is currently in development, certain
versions of the book may contain inaccuracies. I keep a close watch on the
commit log for Rails 4, so these sorts of errors should be resolved in future
updates.

If you find errors or otherwise want to get in touch with me, please do so!
